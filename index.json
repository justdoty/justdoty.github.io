I received my Ph.D. in Economics in 2022 at the University of Iowa, where I specialized in econometrics and empirical industrial organization. My dissertation examined identification and estimation of production functions with unobserved heterogeneity. *Any views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the U.S. Census Bureau\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://justdoty.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently a research economist at the Center for Enterprise Dissemination - Disclosure Avoidance (CED-DA), Research and Applications Group at the U.S. Census Bureau*.
